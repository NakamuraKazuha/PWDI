# PWDIndependence

## Short Description
PWDIndependence is an emergency-response application designed to assist Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in sending distress signals to emergency responders. The system enables responders to access critical user information and location details to facilitate timely and effective assistance.

## Project Goal and Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to enhance the safety and independence of PWDs by providing a reliable mechanism to contact emergency responders. The system allows users to send distress signals, enabling responders to locate them in real time and provide immediate assistance.

Furthermore, this project supports **10 out of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** by promoting accessibility, good health and well-being, sustainable communities, and technological innovation for inclusivity.

## Main Features
- **Emergency Signal Transmission** – Users can send a distress signal with a single button press, ensuring quick access to emergency assistance.
- **Real-time Location Tracking** – The application provides responders with the exact location of the user during an emergency.
- **Emergency Contact Notifications** – Users can notify pre-selected emergency contacts in the event of an emergency.
- **Personalized Medical Data Access** – Responders can retrieve essential user information, including medical conditions and mobility limitations, to provide appropriate aid.
- **User Profile Management** – The application allows users to store and update their personal details, such as name, birth date, address, and contact information.
- **Emergency Signal Analysis** – The system includes heatmap visualization and clustering algorithms to analyze emergency signal distribution, aiding in response optimization.
